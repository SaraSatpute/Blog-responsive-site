# Blog-responsive-site
Creating a responsive blog layout using rem units can be an effective way to ensure your design scales appropriately across different devices and screen sizes. The rem unit stands for "root em" and is relative to the font-size of the root element (typically the &lt;html> element). This makes it a flexible and scalable unit for responsive design.
